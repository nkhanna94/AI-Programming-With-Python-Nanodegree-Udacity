# AI Programming with Python Nanodegree on Udacity 

Welcome to my repository showcasing the projects I completed as part of the Udacity AI Programming with Python Nanodegree. This repository contains two distinct projects focused on image classification using deep learning techniques.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds

This project focuses on leveraging a pre-trained image classifier to identify various dog breeds. The main objective is to utilize a model that has already been trained on a large dataset and fine-tune it for the specific task of dog breed classification. 

### 2. Create Your Own Image Classifier

In this project, I built a Python application from scratch that trains an image classifier on a dataset of flowers. The application can predict the classification of new images based on the trained model.
