## Project Goals ‚ú®

- Accurately identify whether an image contains a dog, even if the breed is misclassified, and distinguish it from non-dog images.
- Correctly classify the specific breed of dog for images that contain dogs.
- Evaluate which Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model architecture‚ÄîResNet, AlexNet, or VGG‚Äîperforms best in achieving objectives 1 and 2.
- Consider the computational resources and time required for each model, and assess if a more efficient solution could yield comparable results within a reasonable time frame.
