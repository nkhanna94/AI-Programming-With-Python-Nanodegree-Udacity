# Create Your Own Image Classifier: 102 Category Flower Dataset ðŸŒ¸

#Overview ðŸ“–
This project builds an image classifier using the 102 Category Flower Dataset. I trained a deep learning model with Vision Transformer (ViT) to classify flower images. Once trained, the model predicts the flower species from new images.

#Objectives âœ¨
Data Preparation: Process image data and map labels to flower categories.
Model Architecture: Use a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) and customize a classifier.
Training and Testing: Train the model and validate its accuracy on unseen images.

#Accuracy ðŸ“Š
The model achieved an impressive accuracy of 91.475% on the test dataset.
